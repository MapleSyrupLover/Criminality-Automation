# Criminality Automation
Criminality is a game made by RVVZ on the game platform Roblox. This repository is dedicated to python scripts to automate boring tasks within the game.
All the python bots so far do not require any access to games memory and only access it via mouse clicks and key presses, all bots are entirely safe to run on main accounts.

## I HAVE ANTI RECOIL CONFIGS COMING SOON (UNDETECTED, DOESNT INJECT, EXTERNAL!)

Stuff I have automated for Criminality so far:
+ Auto-Lockpick 
  - automatically solves the lockpick minigame (version 2 out, version 3 SOON!)
+ Auto Farm ATM (PATCHED)
  - automatically claims allowance from atm on availability, anti AFK included (PATCHED)

Stuff Coming Soon:
+ Auto Farm ATM VERSION 2!!! (this is a big deal as the previous version of this script made me so much money and levels)
   - automatically claims allowance from ATM on availability then moves to the next claimable ATM (Ideas in progress)
+ GIVE ME IDEAS TO MY DISCORD : maple.syrup.lover

## FAQ 

Q: Will I get banned if I use this on my main? 

A: No, this script has a slight buffer on clicks, and does not require injection or executor to prevent even advanced anti cheats (if RVVZ even cared)


Q: How does this work?

A: The script works by checking pixel RGB values and waits for it to change colour to the colour of a pick block, it then clicks SIMPLE!


Q: Are you a furry?

A: I don't know what you are talking about...
